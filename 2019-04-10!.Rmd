```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(stringr)
```

```{r}
install.packages("stringr")
```

```{r}
course <- c("個體經濟學","投資學","總體經濟學")
course
str_subset(course,"經濟學")
```
```{r}
course <- c("個體經濟學","投資學","總體經濟學")
course
str_detect(course,"經濟學")
```
