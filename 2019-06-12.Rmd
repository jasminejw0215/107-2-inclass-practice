## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(stringr)
for(i in seq_along(gmailAddress)){
  if (str_detect(gmailAddress[[i]],"@gmail.com")){
    print(gmailAddress[[i]])}
  else{
    print(str_c(gmailAddress[[i]],"@gmail.com"))
  }

}
```

```{r}
for(i in seq_along(commitHistory)){
  print(
    str_c(
      "Author is ",
      commitHistory[[i]][["commit"]][["author"]][["name"]],
      ". Committer is ",
      commitHistory[[i]][["commit"]][["committer"]][["name"]]
      )
    )
}
```

```{r}
for(i in seq_along(commitHistory)){
  print(commitHistory[[i]][["commit"]][["committer"]][["name"]])
}
```

```{r}
for (i in seq_along(commitHistory)) {

  print(commitHistory[[i]]$commit$author$name)

}
```

```{r}
for (i in seq_along(commitHistory)){
  print(
    commitHistory[[i]][["commit"]][["author"]][["name"]] == commitHistory[[i]][["commit"]][["committer"]][["name"]]
  )
}
```
